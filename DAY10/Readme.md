Strings in Java
Introduction to Strings
A String in Java is a sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. It is one of the most commonly used classes in Java and belongs to the java.lang package. Strings are immutable, meaning that once a String object is created, its contents cannot be changed. Whenever a modification is made, Java creates a new String object instead of altering the existing one. This immutability improves security, thread safety, and memory optimization through the String Constant Pool (SCP). Strings are widely used for storing names, messages, passwords, file paths, URLs, and other textual information.

Example:

String name = "Java";
String course = new String("Programming");
Characteristics of Strings
Immutable in nature.
Stored in the String Constant Pool when created using string literals.
Supports a large number of built-in methods.
Implements the Comparable, Serializable, and CharSequence interfaces.
Can be compared using equals() and compareTo() methods.
Uses Unicode characters, allowing support for multiple languages.
Creating Strings
1. Using String Literal
String s = "Hello";
Stored in the String Constant Pool.
Memory efficient because duplicate literals share the same object.
2. Using new Keyword
String s = new String("Hello");
Creates a new object in heap memory.
Even if the same value exists in SCP, a new object is created.
Common String Methods
Java provides numerous methods for manipulating strings.

1. length()
Returns the number of characters.

String s = "Programming";
System.out.println(s.length());
Output:

11
2. charAt()
Returns the character at a specified index.

String s = "Java";
System.out.println(s.charAt(2));
Output:

v
3. substring()
Extracts part of a string.

String s = "Programming";
System.out.println(s.substring(3));
System.out.println(s.substring(3,7));
Output:

gramming
gram
4. toUpperCase()
Converts all letters to uppercase.

String s = "java";
System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
Output:

JAVA
5. toLowerCase()
Converts all letters to lowercase.

String s = "JAVA";
System.out.println(s.toLowerCase());
Output:

java
6. equals()
Compares string contents.

String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = "Java";

System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));
Output:

true
7. equalsIgnoreCase()
Ignores uppercase and lowercase differences.

String s1 = "JAVA";
String s2 = "java";

System.out.println(s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2));
Output:

true
8. compareTo()
Compares two strings lexicographically.

System.out.println("Apple".compareTo("Banana"));
Negative value because Apple comes before Banana.

9. contains()
Checks whether a string contains another string.

String s = "Java Programming";
System.out.println(s.contains("Java"));
Output:

true
10. startsWith()
Checks starting characters.

String s = "Programming";
System.out.println(s.startsWith("Pro"));
Output:

true
11. endsWith()
Checks ending characters.

String s = "Programming";
System.out.println(s.endsWith("ing"));
Output:

true
12. replace()
Replaces characters.

String s = "Java";
System.out.println(s.replace('a','o'));
Output:

Jovo
13. replaceAll()
Replaces matching patterns.

String s = "Java123";
System.out.println(s.replaceAll("[0-9]",""));
Output:

Java
14. trim()
Removes leading and trailing spaces.

String s = "   Java   ";
System.out.println(s.trim());
15. split()
Splits the string.

String s = "Apple,Mango,Banana";
String arr[] = s.split(",");
16. indexOf()
Returns first occurrence.

String s = "Programming";
System.out.println(s.indexOf('g'));
17. lastIndexOf()
Returns last occurrence.

String s = "Programming";
System.out.println(s.lastIndexOf('g'));
18. isEmpty()
Checks whether the string is empty.

String s = "";
System.out.println(s.isEmpty());
19. concat()
Joins strings.

String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = "Programming";

System.out.println(s1.concat(s2));
20. valueOf()
Converts primitive values into String.

int n = 100;
String s = String.valueOf(n);
String Comparison
Using ==
Compares memory addresses.

String a = "Java";
String b = "Java";

System.out.println(a == b);
Output:

true
Using equals()
Compares actual contents.

String a = new String("Java");
String b = new String("Java");

System.out.println(a.equals(b));
Output:

true
StringBuilder
Introduction
StringBuilder is a mutable class introduced in Java 5. Unlike String, it allows modifications without creating new objects. It is faster than String when performing multiple string operations. However, it is not thread-safe, making it suitable for single-threaded applications.

Example:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java");
Advantages
Mutable
Fast performance
Less memory usage
Suitable for loops
Better than String for repeated modifications
Common StringBuilder Methods
append()
sb.append(" Programming");
insert()
sb.insert(4," Language");
delete()
sb.delete(2,5);
deleteCharAt()
sb.deleteCharAt(3);
replace()
sb.replace(0,4,"Python");
reverse()
sb.reverse();
length()
sb.length();
capacity()
Returns storage capacity.

sb.capacity();
setCharAt()
sb.setCharAt(0,'K');
toString()
Converts StringBuilder into String.

String str = sb.toString();
StringBuffer
Introduction
StringBuffer is also a mutable class used for modifying strings efficiently. Unlike StringBuilder, it is thread-safe because its methods are synchronized. It is slightly slower due to synchronization but is ideal for multi-threaded applications.

Example:

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Java");
Advantages
Mutable
Thread-safe
Suitable for multi-threaded applications
Faster than String for repeated modifications
Common StringBuffer Methods
Most methods are identical to StringBuilder.

append()

insert()

replace()

delete()

deleteCharAt()

reverse()

capacity()

length()

setCharAt()

toString()
Example:

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Java");

sb.append(" Programming");
sb.insert(4," Language");
sb.reverse();

System.out.println(sb);
Difference Between String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer
Feature	String	StringBuilder	StringBuffer
Nature	Immutable	Mutable	Mutable
Performance	Slow for modifications	Fast	Slightly slower
Thread Safety	Safe due to immutability	Not Thread-safe	Thread-safe
Synchronization	No	No	Yes
Memory Usage	Higher	Lower	Lower
Best Used For	Fixed text	Single-threaded applications	Multi-threaded applications
String Constant Pool (SCP)
The String Constant Pool is a special memory area inside the heap where Java stores unique string literals. When a string literal is created, Java first checks whether the same value already exists in the pool. If it does, Java reuses the existing object instead of creating a new one, which saves memory and improves performance.

Example:

String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = "Java";

System.out.println(s1 == s2);
Output:

true
Both variables point to the same object in the String Constant Pool.

Applications of Strings
User input validation
Password checking
Searching and sorting text
File handling
Data parsing
Web development
Database operations
Text processing
Email and URL validation
Log file analysis
Conclusion
Strings are a fundamental part of Java programming and are used extensively for handling textual data. The immutable nature of String ensures security and efficient memory management through the String Constant Pool. Java also provides StringBuilder and StringBuffer for situations where strings need to be modified frequently. StringBuilder offers high performance for single-threaded applications, while StringBuffer provides thread safety for multi-threaded environments. Understanding the features, methods, and differences among these classes enables developers to write efficient, optimized, and maintainable Java programs.
